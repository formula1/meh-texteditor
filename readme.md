# Test Editor
A proof of concept and test application to hit the boundries of tEmbO. Don't expect this to be edited too much, currently its a pet project but through my adventures I found it a lot of work to do alone.

# Goals
- Have the text editor display in similar ways across platforms
  - browser
  - blessed
  - native script
- Ensure most of the heavy lifting is done outside of the rendering systems

# Slightly Lofy Goals
- Implement KeyBindings
- Enable Atom themes to be applied to it

# Lofty Goals (Aka probably not going to happen)
- Create a Line/Col notification System - mainly for linters
- Create an AutoComplete System - Provides current Scope and words/symbols related to those
